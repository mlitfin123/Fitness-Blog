            <h1>Quarantined and Unmotivated</h1>
        </header>
        <p> 
                Like everybody else in the world I am currently stuck inside. Told I will risk lives and farther spread a deadly virus if I left my apartment for non-essential reasons. I was originally confused and unhappy with being forced indoors for the unforeseeable future over a virus which has similar symptoms and death rate as the flu, but I can now see why this is a necessary action after seeing just how much more contagious this is than any other sickness we know about.<br><br>
                Being forced to quarantine and seeing the country shut down has affected everybody in some way. For me personally I am most depressed about not having my normal gym and fitness routine that I am used to. I am lucky I was able to barely attend and compete in my most recent competition, the Arnold Amateur, even though the expo was canceled. I spent a period immediately following the competition creating my post-contest goals for the upcoming year. This included increasing my strength for power-lifting, adjusting my diet to not get fat, and increasing my running speed.<br><br>
                Once the gyms were shut down and we were all told to isolate I immediately got depressed and threw all these goals out the window. It’s not the most logical thing to do, but I have currently gone a month without being in the gym which is the longest I’ve gone since college when alcohol was more important to me. My whole routine and all my goals seemed to be taken away and I became lost.<br><br>
                I know this is not who I am, after constantly preaching the importance of developing the right mindset I had fallen victim to becoming depressed over something I can’t control. So here I am making a post on finding motivation when you find yourself in a situation you have no control over.
            <h2>Goals:</h2>
                You always need a goal, preferably a specific goal and preferably one that seems just out of reach. If you find yourself in a situation that you can’t control and have an obstacle to reach that goal then adjust it or find a way around that obstacle.
                I will have trouble accomplishing my power-lifting goals without weights to lift, but you know what? I can now spend time on my other goals. I can work on being a faster runner, I have run the most in the past month than I’ve done in 2 years.
                I will also have trouble increasing muscle size for my bodybuilding goals, but you know what? A big weakness of mine has been my abs, so I now have plenty of time to work on that while doing at home body-weight workouts.
            <h2>Create a Plan:</h2>
                It’s nice to have the goals, but now you must have a plan in place to accomplish these goals. Once you have a plan the likelihood of you accomplishing the goal increases dramatically.
                I created my goals about a week ago, but realized I was having trouble sticking to them. So I decided to actually schedule a time to workout everyday and which workout to do. This includes a run in the morning, followed by at least 300 push-ups and 300 squats throughout the day. I also have dumbbells and bands in my apartment to hit each body part every day. Since I am working remote this is easy for me to stick to, but you need to figure out what works best for you around your schedule.
            <h2>Make it a Priority:</h2>
                So many people preach balance, and while I believe this is important, I believe you won’t accomplish any goal unless you make it a priority over everything else each day. Fitness needs to be a priority, you can still enjoy life, but you can’t just say okay I’ll do a short workout here and there because I want balance. This will lead to goals always being there but never being accomplished.
                Everyday I know I need to do my workout, while it is not a good idea for most people to obsess over it like I do, if you want to develop a competitive level of fitness you absolutely have to make it a priority over everything until it gets done. I carve in that 1-2 hours each day that I know I need to do my workout over everything else. If it’s not a priority it will be much easier to skip the workout and you will have more trouble reaching those goals.
            <h2>Current Quarantine Fitness Goals:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Run under a 20 min 5k</li>
                    <li>Develop healthy eating habits at around maintenance or slightly above maintenance calories</li>
                    <li>Maintain as much muscle and abs as possible with body-weight workouts</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Plan to Accomplish My Goals:</h2>
