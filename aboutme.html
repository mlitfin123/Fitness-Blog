    <h1>About Me</h1>
  </div>
    <hr/>
    <p> My name is Mark Litfin. I am an amateur bodybuilder and powerlifter with an education in exercise
      and experience working in the fitness industry. My education includes a Bachelor's in Exercise Science from
      Salisbury University and certifications as a Health Fitness Specialist and Personal Trainer from ACSM.<br><br>
      Now that's out of the way I can mention a little more about who I am and what motivated me to start this page.
      I have been interested in sports and fitness ever since I was young. I ran track in high school and have played soccer recreationally my entire life.
      I participated in rugby in college and tried my hand as a semi-pro football player after college. In other words sports has always been a major component of my life.
      As I got older I started getting into lifting weights and nutrition which led me into competing in my first bodybuilding competition in 2013. I took
      3rd place out of 12 in that competition and I've been hooked ever since. I've competed in 12 shows and counting including 3 national shows, I've done well in some and not so well in others
      but I use each one as a learning experience since I've always done my own training and nutrition. I decided a few years ago that I wanted a new challenge
      in between my bodybuilding training so I decided to compete in my first powerlifting meet. I've now done 3 powerlifting meets
      as I became hooked to the feeling of hitting a PR and getting stronger each week. When I'm not training for powerlifting or bodybuilding I'm 
      running races. I've done countless 5k's and 10k's with one half marathon and a 10 miler thrown in there, not to mention the OCR events I've
      participated in.<br><br>
      Throughout each one of my events I did countless hours of research and testing on my own body to find what works and what doesn't, what 
      fits best for me and what doesn't and I have come across so much mis-leading or contradictory information that I got overwhelmed 
      and now I rarely read from anybody who isn't proven to be reputable. I'm not saying I'm the most knowledgeable in this field 
      but I've now been around it long enough that I feel very confident in what I do know. I am no longer working professionally in fitness since 
      I just lost interest once I started. The field was not what I thought it was so I have since just decided to use it as a hobby while pursuing other avenues. 
      That does not mean that I have not continued to increase my knowledge each year. I still need to keep up to date with everything for my own 
      personal competition goals which I don't plan on giving up anytime soon. I decided to create this page because I was overwhelmed and I know a lot 
      of others are also. I want to help clear up some of that confusion while also sharing the knowledge I have learned over the years I've been working out and 
      competing. I do not have an interest in training anybody, but I will be more than willing to answer any questions or concerns anybody might have.
